## ⚡️ Notre Dame Experimental Propulsion Avionics Team ⚡️
<!--
### As NDXP works to fire the university's first ever liquid fueled rocket, the avionics team is responsible for providing:


- Analytical Insight 📈
  <p>When our tests succeed (or fail), we collect the data that tells the team why.</p>
- Autonomous Safety 💥
  <p>If something goes wrong, our electronics are the first to know, and must be the first to respond.</p>
- Ignition Sequencing 🧨
  <p>Our systems fire the Engine</p>
- Robust Communication 📡
  <p>We provide real-time metrics at a distance.</p>
